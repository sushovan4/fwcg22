## Motivation

- Graphs representaion facilitates easy desciption of relational patterns
- Pattern Recognition becomes the problem of measuring similarity between two
graphs
- A distance measure is deemed *meaningful* if
    - small distance implies similarity
    - large distance reveals dissimilarity

- Graph comaprison has been widely studied both by the *Pattern Recognition* and *Database* community.
    - Geometric graphs are new! [@cgkss-msgg-09]


## This Morning's Agenda
- What is a *Geometric Graph*?
- Where are they?
- Why defining a similarity measure for them is challenging?
- The two friends: *GED* and *GGD*
- How the two measures compare?
- Computational complexity results
- Questions?

## Geometric Graphs $\mathbb{R}^d$
A combinatorial graph $G=(V,E)$ is called *geometric* if  

- $V\subset\mathbb{R}^d$  
- An edge $(u,v)\in E$ is identified with the line segment $\overline{uv}$ 
- edges intersect only at their endpoints

## How to Define Distance between Two Graphs?
Given two geometric graphs $G, H$:

- check if they are (combinatorial) isomorphic
    - not robust
    - not lenient to local, minor defects
- correct *small* defects, but at a *small* cost

## Geometric Edit Operations

- deletion (or insertion) of a vertex does not cost
- deletion (or insertion) of an edge costs $C_E$ times its length
- translation of a vertex costs $C_V$ times the displacment plus $C_E$ times
the total length changes in the incident edges.

. . .

## Geometric Edit Distance (GED)
$$GED(G,H):=\inf cost(P),$$
where the infimum is taken over all edit paths from $G$ to $H$.

. . . 

> GED is a metric for positive $C_V, C_E$.

### Cons
- not computationally feasible
- infinitely many edit paths
- uncountable alphabet

## Geometric Graph Distance (GGD)

### Inexact Matching Correspondence
- define $\pi$

$$
    \cost(\pi)= 
    \underbrace{\sum_{\substack{u\in V^G \\ \pi(u)\neq\epsilon_V}} 
    C_V\lvert u-\pi(u)|}_\text{vertex translations} + 
    \underbrace{\sum_{\substack{e\in E^G \\ \pi(e)\neq\epsilon_E}} 
    C_E\big||e|-|\pi(e)|\big|}_\text{edge translations} + 
    \underbrace{\sum_{\substack{e\in E^G \\ \pi(e)=\epsilon_E}} C_E|e|}
    _\text{edge deletions} + 
    \underbrace{\sum_{\substack{f\in E^H \\ \pi^{-1}(f)=\epsilon_E}} C_E|f|}
    _\text{edge deletions}
$$

$$
\ggd(G,H)\eqdef\min_{\pi\in\Pi(G,H)}\cost(\pi).
$$

- GGD is a metric.

## Comparing GED and GGD
$$
\ggd(G,H)\leq\ged(G,H)\leq\left(1+\Delta\frac{C_E}{C_V}\right)\ggd(G,H)
$$

## Compexity of GGD

### Known Results
- NP-hard for highly non-planar instances
- NP-hard for planar if $C_V<<C_E$

### Our Results
- NP-hard even if (i) planar, (ii) $C_V,C_E$ arbitrary

## Further Questions
- APX-hardness
- PSAT
- How to choose $C_V, C_E$, machine learning??
